# Design Portfolio

![Portfolio Logo](assets/me.png)

This is essentially an update and migration of my original temporary portfolio on wix. Coded from scratch and with added visual house-keeping.

In its current rendition, it only has the front, index page, but I'll be slowly adding individual projects and a gallery as time allows.

Original seen here: https://cameront4504.wixsite.com/design-portfolio

Things to do:
- Change all language to 3rd person
- Mess with filters or fix colors of gallery to avoid contrast issues
- Fix section spacing / experiment with vh(?)
- Actually add the rest of the pages
